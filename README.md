# Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-System
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is like a security camera for your network. Just as security cameras help identify suspicious activities in the physical world, an IDS will monitor your network to help detect any potential cyber attacks and security breaches.

# Understanding the Types of IDS

Network-based IDS (NIDS): This system monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.

Host-based IDS (HIDS): This system monitors system logs and file changes on individual hosts and is not directly deployed in the network.

Signature-based IDS: This system is either in the network or on the host and identifies attack patterns based on known patterns.

Anomaly-based IDS: This system identifies unusual behavior using heuristics and prediction algorithms that are trained on previously seen attack patterns.
