# Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-System
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is like a security camera for your network. Just as security cameras help identify suspicious activities in the physical world, an IDS will monitor your network to help detect any potential cyber attacks and security breaches.

# Understanding the Types of IDS

Network-based IDS (NIDS): This system monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.

Host-based IDS (HIDS): This system monitors system logs and file changes on individual hosts and is not directly deployed in the network.

Signature-based IDS: This system is either in the network or on the host and identifies attack patterns based on known patterns.

Anomaly-based IDS: This system identifies unusual behavior using heuristics and prediction algorithms that are trained on previously seen attack patterns.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python. The IDS monitors network traffic, analyzes it for suspicious activities, and generates alerts for potential threats.

## Components
The IDS consists of four main components:
- **Packet Capture**: Captures network packets.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyzes the captured packets and extracts relevant features.
- **Detection Engine**: Detects threats using signature-based and anomaly-based methods.
- **Alert System**: Generates alerts for detected threats.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-System
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the IDS
To start the IDS, run the following command:
```sh
python ids/ids.py
```

## Testing the IDS
To test the IDS with mock data, run:
```sh
python tests/test_ids.py
```

## Extending the IDS
There are several ways to enhance the IDS:
- Incorporate advanced machine learning models for better threat detection.
- Optimize performance for high-traffic networks.
- Integrate with external systems for notifications and monitoring.

## Security Considerations
- Run the IDS with appropriate permissions.
- Secure the alert logs and implement log rotation.
- Regularly update signature rules and retrain anomaly detection models.
- Monitor system resource usage.
